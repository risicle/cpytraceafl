        Installs instrumenting bytecode rewriter.

        Monkeypatches builtins.compile and importlib's .pyc file reader with wrapper which will
        rewrite code object's line number information in a way suitable for basic block
        tracing.

        This should be called as early as possible in a target program - any imports performed
        before the rewriter is installed will cause their modules to not be properly rewritten
        and so not properly traced.

        `selector` can be used to control which code objects are instrumented and to what
        degree. This can be a callable which takes a single argument, `code`, the code object
        about to be rewritten. This callable should return:
         - True, to indicate the code object should be fully instrumented for tracing.
         - False, indicating the code object should receive no instrumentation and tracing
           should not happen here.
         - A numeric value indicating the approximate percentage of potential locations that
           should be instrumented for this code. This equates approximately to AFL_INST_RATIO.

        Alternatively `selector` can be set to one of the above values to act on all code
        objects with that behaviour equally.

        The default, None, will attempt to read the environment variable AFL_INST_RATIO and
        apply that behaviour to all code. Failing that, it'll instrument everything 100%.
